class Actor(Thing):
    """
    Actors are Things that are capable of conversations.

    Topics can be added using the `addTopic` method. SpecialTopics are added using the
    `addSpecialTopic` method.

    Actors track their available topics in dictionaries, depending on topic type.
    Each Actor has a dicitonary for `ask_topics`, `tell_topics`, `give_topics`, and
    `show_topics`, to which Topic objects can be added, as well as a `special_topics`
    dictionary for SpecialTopics.

    All topics that are currently in these dictionaries are considered to be active, and
    will be available in converstions.

    Actors can also buy and sell items. This can be enabled by adding an item using the
    `addSelling` or `addWillBuy` methods.

    Items the Actor is willing to sell or buy are stored in the `for_sale` and `will_buy`
    dictionaries on the Actor object. More specifically, objects of the SaleItem class
    are stored here, serving as records of what is for sale/what is wanted, and templates
    for the transactions.

    If you need to access a SaleItem created by `addSelling`/`addWillBuy`, you can look
    it up in the Actor's `for_sale` or `will_buy` dictionary. The key is the IFPObject
    index of the relevant Thing, which can be found in the Thing's `ix` attribute.
    For example, if an Actor `person` sells a Thing called `item`, we can look up the
    SaleItem with `person.for_sale[item.ix]`.

    Topic (base) is meant to be added to an Actor as an ask/tell/give/show topic -

    As well as printing text, a Topic can add and remove SpecialTopics from its Actor
    when it is triggered. Set SpecialTopics to *add* to the Actor by adding the
    SpecialTopic objects to the Topic's `new_suggestions`. Add them to `expire_suggestions`
    to remove them.

    The Topic itself contains no reference to any Thing or Abstract to which a given
    Actor will associate it. This connection is created when the Topic is added to the
    Actor with addTopic, and then, exists only on the Actor object. This means that the
    same Topic can be added as a response to multiple things.

    A single Topic should *not* be added to multiple Actors at the same time, as this
    will break suggestion functionality.
